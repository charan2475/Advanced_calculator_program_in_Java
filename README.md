# Advanced_calculator_program_in_Java
The above Java code is an advanced calculator program that allows users to perform various mathematical operations. It is a command-line calculator, meaning the user interacts with the program by entering input through the console.

Here's a brief description of the key components of code:

User Input:
The program starts by prompting the user to enter the first number. After that, it asks the user to provide the operator for the desired mathematical operation. Finally, the program prompts the user to enter the second number (for binary operations).

Mathematical Operations:
The program supports the following mathematical operations:

Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first number.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second number.
Exponentiation (^): Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
Modulo (%): Computes the remainder after division of the first number by the second number.
Square Root (sqrt): Calculates the square root of a non-negative number.
Absolute Value (abs): Calculates the absolute value of a number.
Sine (sin), Cosine (cos), Tangent (tan): Calculates the trigonometric functions for an angle given in degrees.
Logarithm (log): Calculates the base 10 logarithm of a positive number.
Natural Logarithm (ln): Calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of a positive number.
Factorial (!): Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.
Floor Division (//): Performs integer division and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the quotient.
Power of Ten (10^): Calculates 10 raised to the power of the entered number.
Power of Two (2^): Calculates 2 raised to the power of the entered number.
Error Handling:
The program includes error handling for various scenarios to prevent division by zero, negative square roots, and undefined trigonometric values.

Recursion for Factorial:
The factorial operation is implemented using recursion, which means it calls itself repeatedly until the base case is reached.

Output:
After performing the selected mathematical operation, the program displays the result to the user on the console.

User Interaction:
The program uses a Scanner to read user input from the console, making it interactive and allowing the user to perform multiple calculations in a single run.

Overall, the code provides a comprehensive calculator experience, allowing users to perform a wide range of mathematical operations with error handling for invalid inputs.
